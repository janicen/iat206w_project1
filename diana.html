			<h2>Brazil</h2>

			<p>Looking at the elements of national identity and multiculturalism in Brazil, this study focuses on the popular cultures deeply embedded in Brazilian culture. Then, the possibility of methods to translate American comic book hero, Captain America, are proposed. The goal of doing so is to adapt the character in a new cultural context, hence the new character is more appropriate for Brazilian culture. The popular cultures of Brazil in discussion are football, graphic novel, film and radio overall. Each of these popular cultures is analyzed using conceptual frameworks consisting of media concepts: color, meme, comic, color, television, embodiment, imagination, globalization, hybridity and remediation. The questions in this paper are: What has contributed to modern Brazil and current pop culture? How this culture emerged and what kind of characteristics of popular culture are displayed associated with national identity of Brazil? Throughout the research, the phenomena found in popular cultures are questioned and examined to discover comparison and contrast to Captain America. This method lead to suggestions for potential design in reshaping Captain America embodying/reflecting to the Brazilian culture.</p>

			<h4>Comic Book Pretense</h4><br>

			<p>The reason for choosing to research Brazil and Captain America was due to its’ potential market. According to <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com">Box Office Mojo</a>, the total net grossing of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458339/"><i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i></a><i> </i>(2011) in Brazil was <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&amp;id=captainamerica.htm">$20,681,912</a>. This amount is one of the top four among foreign countries. Based on this data, our group decided to look at top four countries and study one of four countries. The objective is to translate character of Captain America into the context of four countries: United Kingdom, Russia, Brazil and Mexico.
			</p>

			<h4>Method</h4><br>

			<p>To understand this phenomenon, it might be interesting to look at the aspects of Brazilian culture, which allowed Captain America movie to make huge profit in theatre. I attempted an inductive research by collecting various sources such as articles, images, sound and videos to find patterns. The process of research involved using Google search, Tumblr, Twitter, YouTube, and scholarly articles.</p>

			<p>The focus here is to analyze popular cultures in Brazil and identifying popular cultures, which displays national identity and motif. The graphic novels, football, architecture, television and radio are discussed in terms of cultural and media concepts. Throughout the paper, the name Captain Brazil is to address the proposal for new character based on Captain America.</p>

			<h4>Who is Captain America?</h4><br>

			<p>Before going into research, it is important to learn who <a href="http://marvel.com/captainamerica%23/home">Captain America </a>is and what are the elements that consists of his identity. Created by two American cartoonist Joe Simon and Jack Kirby back in 1940s, Captain America is a fictional character and a superhero from a comic book which later was adapted to various media forms such as films, games, television, music, theatre and referenced throughout many others. For this research, the focus will be on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458339/"><i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i></a>(2011) film.</p>

			<p>Captain America, also known as Steve Rogers is a national symbol and patriotic soldier and a hero in the historical background of World War II. He meets a challenge in enlisting for US army due to his lack of physical ability to pass the examination to become a soldier, however he displays courage and willingness to protect and sacrifice himself for others. His bravery and strong will allows him to be selected as candidate for a project by US army to create super soldier, using “Super Soldier Serum.” Captain America has qualities and an ideal representation of national identity of US through design of his physique, attire, colors, shield, and his personality. Now, the question is how can to learn from this character and translate it to another culture. In this case, Brazilian culture.</P>

			<h4>Ideas About “Comic Book” Premise</h4>

			<p>To begin with, a list of concepts were listed to help focus the research furthermore. Malandro and football were included in the list since they are related to Brazil’s national identity.
			<ul>
				<li>Man or women representing a country’s national identity.</li>
				<li>Minority represented instead of ideal or majority or stereotypical representation.</li>
				<li>Figure that embodies associate hero figure (‘malandro’) from Brazil.</li>
			<li>Introduce Captain America to Brazil popular culture of sports (Football, malandro - national identity).</li>
			</ul></p>

			<h4>Color</h4><br>
			<p>Picturing unfamiliar culture can be difficult, so I began with images to get general sense of the communities in Brazil. When you google Brazil, images and key word one see are flag, football, Christ the Redeemer statue, Germany versus Brazil World Cup meme, slums (favela) of Rio de Janeiro, extravagantly dressed Samba dancers, cities by the ocean. Many of the images display rich and colorful appearance. Interesting fact about these images is mix of people with various skin colors. This reflects multiculturalism in Brazil; according to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a>, there are white, mulatto (person of mix of black and white ancestry), black, Asian and Indigenous population in the country.There were few images of Japanese culture in Brazil found during Google search as well.</p>

			</div>

			<p>From here on, my focus on multiculturalism in Brazil relating to color has brought up a topic of racial discrimination history. A person’s skin color represent upper or lower class in Brazil. There are racial ideologies reflecting this perspective in Brazilian society. One example is ‘democracia racial’. Marcia L. Mikulak (2011) describes ‘Brazilian elites’ shaped <i>democracia racial </i>as a way of establishing undetectable source of ‘negative stereotypes‘ in the society since ‘the abolition of slavery’ (p.65). Mikulak points this out by stating how the talk of racial issue is rarely discussed in public media and how this behavior became the norm.  Certain stigmatism is placed on a person by his or her skin-color. The issues of social inequalities and division are shown in the architecture in major cities in Brazil as well.</p>

			<p>Another feature that stood out in the images were yellow, blue, green colors on football team, samba dancers, soccer fans, graffiti on a walls. These three colors are flag colors of Brazil, which are used through out many media such as body paint, attire, team uniform to represent and to embody the national identity of Brazil. The color is acting as a messenger to communicate certain nationality with combination of three colors. Color proves it to be a way for a person distinguish national identity but also one’s status in a society.</p>

			</div>

			<p>Considering these findings, there are similarities found in the national identity and the social status of Captain America. Captain America is a white male who has an uniform with American flag motif. This practice of color clearly represents himself as a hero of the nation and emphases the patriotism side of the character. Brazil’s captain can<i> embody this idea</i> by relying on the immediacy of the color combination to represent the nation.</p>

			<h4>Architecture</h4><br>

			<p>In the dozens of images of streets and sceneries in few major cities, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador, there are many old and crowded houses, European style buildings, modern buildings and with colorful facade. With over

			<a href="http://livepage.aphttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.htmlple.com/">sixty percents of population as Roman Catholics</a>, numerous churches mediating religious culture of Brazil are prominent throughout the cities. The images of Rio de Janeiro shows extreme contrast between the poor side of the city and the rich areas booming with tourists, surfers, and people; Christ the Redeemer statue, five star hotels, the Royal Portuguese Cabinet of Reading (designed by Rafael da Silva e Castro) with extravagant European design contrasts with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS_PjwaqZYE">favela</a>, which also known as slum.</p>

			<p>As shown in the video, the favelas have issues of drug dealing, gangs and gun fights in different areas of slums. Shoot out between police and local drug traffickers are part of daily life. The favela consists of political graffitis, crowded houses and buildings. Many of the Anti-Fifa Graffitis narrates social issues and poverty issues. Going back to contrast between rich and poor, many of them portrays theme of poor Black child and World Cup. Natasha Pravaz (2008) explains division of ‘race and class’ in the city of Rio:</P>

				<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the previously rural Zona Sul has been progressively populated by a growing white upper-middle class, who enjoys easy access to the beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana and a close view of the internationally-known <i>morros</i> (hills) of Corcovado and the Sugar Loaf. The Zona Norte, on the other hand, gradually expanded to encompass several smaller municipalities and is home to the largest working-class, under- and unemployed population in the country, second only to São Paulo. (p. 81)</p>

			<p>This shows clear picture of fragmented social statuses in Brazil. The life in the cities varies greatly with existing social hierarchy through coexisting community of rich and favela. Inductive analysis through collection of Brazilian architecture images shows history of European colonial era, major religious belief and contrast between social classes geographically. The part of building aesthetics embodying these cultural identities.</p>

			<h4>How are the aspect of Brazilian cities represented in different culture?</h4><br>

			<p>The cities of Brazil has been appearing in various American comics and films. <i>The Incredible Hulk </i>takes in place of favela in Brazil. Other notable locations of Brazil are present in American media. Amazon Rain forest shows up in DC Comics such as <i>Global Guardians</i>.</p>

			<p>Based on this research, I began thinking about what Brazil’s Captain would be fighting for. Beginning with the rescue mission of his best friend and his unit from the enemy, Captain America fought for War World II against Nazi’s secret criminal organization called HYDRA and antagonist such as red skull, in order to fight against terrorism. The reason behind his action is his bond and patriotism. For Brazil’s Captain, it could be about racial issues and division to draw attention to topics, which Brazil people can related to.  Also, it would be helpful for character development. The poor and the rich. The tension and criminal activities happening in the slums. The important question here is: What would the Captain be fighting for?</p>

			<h4><b>Globalization and Cultural Hybridity</b></h4><br>

			<p>Multiculturalism is deeply rooted in the culture of Brazil including history of Portuguese colonization of Latin America, slavery of African and Indigenous people, and immigration of Asian population. Located in Eastern South America, current Brazil society consists of White, Mulatto, Black, Asian and Indigenous people. Alex Bellos (2014) explains, “Brazil is the country of carnival, not of self-negating uniformity” (p. 34). With Black population making up around <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html">7.6% </a>of the population and mix of European traditions and African traditions, Brazilian population together built many of today’s traditions and customs such as football, samba music, dance and carnival.</p>

			<h4>Imagination - Folk tale hero - Malandro</h4><br>

			<p>Throughout the media in Brazil, topic of Malandro, a folk hero and a person of Brazilian malandragem stereotype can be found in the sports, samba music and lyrics. It is a significant symbolism rooted in Brazilian media.  João Gabriel L. C. Teixeira (2003) explains malandragem’s moral principle focuses on forming idealistic world where ‘tolerance and and unpredictability’ is possible in life (p. 32). Malandragem represent a lifestyle of a rogue or a con artist who result to trickery in their way of life. This type of image influences on various media as a heroic figure. It  became an important part of Brazilian national identity such as Brazilian football.</p>

			<p>Many scholarly articles and books examining football culture in Brazil often mentions malandro in discussion of the sports culture and national identity. Bellos (2014) mentions that malandro transformed style of football from ‘an orderly British game’ to ‘a dance of irrational surprises’ (p.36). The influence of malandro seems to define Brazilian identities besides the Brazilian football style as well. In <i>An Ethnography of the 2006 World Cup in Brazilian Cities</i>, Édison Gastaldo explains, “[in] Brazil, soccer is always called ‘<i>jogo</i>’, a term that defines both gambling and sports, while in England the two words define completely different activities” (Gastaldo, 2007, p. 14). As it defines Brazilian football distinctively different from the original European definition of the sport, maladragem helped developed a distinctive national identity known as ‘Brazilian-ness’. The term Malandro can be found in <a href="http://letras.mus.br/chico-buarque/45135/">samba music</a> as well. It will be discussed in Samba Music and Dance section later.</p>

			<p>I believe character of Captain Brazil can be developed, considering the definition of what it means to be Brazilian. The heroic figure yet cunning type of character can be considered since such characteristic admired by people of Brazil. Through this method, Captain’s national identity can be strengthened and aligned with Brazil’s ideologies.</p>

			<h4>Football - body, embodiment</h4><br>

			<p>One of the well-known and most popular sport in the world, football is a huge enthusiasm for communities of Brazil people. The history behind the sport goes back to United Kingdom in 1800s when it was beginning to be recognized as an official sports. To understand the culture of Brazil, it is important to understand the culture of football, social issues and histories surrounding the subject. As national identity and pride of Brazil, football can be seen throughout the the streets of Rio de Janeiro.

			The scene of playing soccer can be seen on the beaches, in a stadium or streets in a slum. A group of slum children and men playing soccer with a worn out soccer ball on a dirt ground. [insert images]  Bellos (2014) explains that “[football] was both the private hobby of the rich and the preferred pastime of gangs of poor youths” (p. 31). Many children who plays football in favela are too poor to afford proper place let alone stadium. Despite the dangerous environment of these slums, children enjoys playing soccer. Alex Bellos (2014) describes:<p>

				<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Since most Brazilians learnt from informal kickabouts, it was likely that they would play in a way less constrained by rules, tactics or conventions. Since many started playing using bundles of socks, it was also likely that their ball skills would be more highly developed and inventive. (p. 34)</p>

			<p>The harsh conditions of playing the sport in such environment might have contributed to their unique style for the sport in one way or another. [ADD VIDEO] Watching numerous Youtube videos of Brazilian soccer stars who play on the Brazil’s national team or other notorious soccer teams in U.S. or other Latin American countries, you can see each players displaying trickery against the opponent; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3p6kOdZ4Mo">Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKGFN21m4D0">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5FZq5SPRTo">Ronaldo de Assis Moreira</a> are few of the well-known football stars. These players shows tricks and skills consist of light steps, faking direction of the kick number of times and confusing the other team’s soccer player. The keywords followed by their names in YouTube search video tells how notorious they are in football world. For example, Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, also known as Ronaldinho, often Youtube video associated with his name comes up with keyword such as legend or legendary. Many of the videos focus on the fascinating skills and tricks these players display during games.</P>

			<h4>Football - radio, television</h4><br>

			<p>The media which allowed spread of sports event was through radio and television.  Édison Gastaldo (2014) informs that:</p>

			<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Since the beginning of the regular international transmission of soccer matches on the radio, in the early 1950s, the coverage of Brazil’s matches in the World Cup has produced amazing audiences....a radio station in São Paulo installed a huge panel painted as a soccer field covered with lamps in the Praça da Sé (a large square in the centre of the city), with a public sound system transmitting live on their own radio. (p. 126)</p>

			<p>The games are reached mass audience using radio first, then by television. The radio primarily relies on the voice of broadcaster narrating the play. In contrast to that, the television captures the game by portraying in addition to broadcaster’s voice narrating in the background. Gastaldo (2014) explains, “...with dozens of still and mobile cameras spread out all over the field, showing many different angles of the match, this media narrative is even more emphatic....effectively broadcasted are chosen according to a peculiar codification of television narrative...” (p. 124). Gastaldo brings up example of several replay of goal scene, which emphasizes the moment and the excitement of the scene. Highlighting emotional aspect of the game, the medium of radio and television delivers different perspective of the game and audience engagement. One with relaying on sound. Latter one relaying on both image and sound. The move from radio to television brought opportunity to reach national and global audience as well. Globalization and popularity of football throughout the world had made it possible for soccer players to become pop icon in the global stage, therefore creating business opportunity to market national identities. Marcos Alvito (2007) states, vigorous push to transform football into ‘mega-business’ happened as ‘Brazilian’ João Havelange was appointed as FIFA president in 1974 (p. 527). However, there has been negative effects of globalization of football. The diaspora happened with soccer players moving to play for teams outside of Brazil. Alvito (2007) explains, “In 2004 alone, according to official data published by the Brazilian Football Confederation, 857 football players were transferred to teams in other countries” (p. 531). Referring to this data, Alvito analyzes how the influence of ‘football diaspora’ — fall of ‘technical level’ — in Brazil due to outsourcing players happened, and broadcasting of sport on television lead to low number of audiences for the sport. Also, the globalization of sport left the country to face various social problems.</p>

			<h4>Football - social issues</h4><br>

			<p>With World Cup coming to brazil, money is being spent on the game and not enough on solving poverty and existing social issues. </i>There are efforts to solve poverty utilizing soccer to create opportunity.

			There are non-profit organization such as <a href="http://www.ibiss.info">IBISS</a> (Instituto Brasileiro de Inovações em Saúde Social) for children in the slums to escape poverty through football.

			<p>By examining social media posts and memes, there are statements and concerns of people on social media, who speaks of poverty and low living standards especially in favela. Aline Frey (2014) explains,<i> </i>“In 2011, the city administration signed a protocol<i> </i>authorizing the institutionalization of children living on the streets, especially drug addicts” (p. 66).<i> </i>The country deals with social issues using a violent approach to solve homelessness. The violence in the street is not dealt with. For example, there are shoot out between drug traffickers and police shoot out streets of favela daily. Alvito explains how the failure to solve many social issues highlighted by football is reflected in the current trend. Alvito (2007) tells:</p>

			<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Obviously, many different factors led to this drop in spectators: poor administration, violence both within and outside the stadium’s walls, the demoralization of Brazilian football following a spate of scandals, as well transformations within Brazilian society itself: increased unemployment and the progressive decimation of the working class. (p. 533).</P>

			<p>The social unrest is clearly shown with World Cup 2014, which included one of the most expansive projects compared to the past and protests of Rio’s educated student against police bodies. </p>

			</div>

			<p>Memes and images of gratifies can be examined to reveal the aspect of social unrest in Brazil as well. Memes are one way to look into the sports world of Brazil. Internet search using keywords brazil football meme brings up humorous and funny remediation of original images by addition of text or imaged. Examining them, one can pick out social issues presented in the memes are about response to poverty issue in general and black children in poverty.  Besides from memes, many Tumblr posts, images,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58aLRl_eG7Y"> Youtube Videos</a> brought up topic of human rights issues, violations, low living standard, pointing figures at World Cup. These social media posts involved topic of poverty, death, corruption, violence and drugs, eviction.</p>

			<p>Another issue at hand is the racial inequality. The elitism exists in the world of sport and cultural of Brazil; social hierarchy discussed in terms of skin-color earlier revealed that the rich and poor images associated with color.  The similar type of inequality can be explored with the topic of nation’s sports as well. Elitism embedded and explained by Emanuelle Oliveira-Monte (2013):</P>

			<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Although there was never official segregation in Brazilian sports, at the beginning of the twentieth century, blacks faced racism and elitism and had to struggle to be incorporated into soccer’s major league, the AMEA, <i>Associação Metropolitana de Futebol</i>. (p. 79)</p>

			<p>Similar to idea of <i>democracia racial</i>, elitism influences the social hierarchy in Brazil. Oliveira-Monte’s talk about racism and elitism in sports world is another example of color dictating the social status of a person.</p>

			<p>There are depth of history and social issues to look at in terms of character development. The topic of racial inequalities and social issues in present football culture can be discussed through Brazil’s captain. Will football be part of past time? Is character Afro-Brazilian or White? How will that affect the background story of the character? Would he be from rich part of the city or the poor part of the city? The enthusiasm for soccer could be added to part of his character to strength the character as national identity of Brazil, yet I believe it could be interesting to have him fight for justice and improvement of poverty.  These help develop aim, morality and values, which character will have.</p>

			<h4>Samba Music and Dance </h4><br>

			<p>Along with malandragem and football, samba is an essence of Brazil’s national identity. In <i>Encyclopædia Britannica, </i>it is explained that “Samba crossed the colour line and rose to national popularity through the radio and recording industries in the 1940s” (“Latin American dance,” 2015). The Google search of samba images shows many dark-skinned women dancers and male drummers. Their facial expression and body gesture embodies energy and vibrance. In Rio Carnival, dancers celebrates samba in an organized extravagant parade with music and exquisite costumes with vibrant colors, feathers and many jewelry. The carnival serves as  a spectating purposes, but it also is a big competition between many samba schools. The history of samba goes back to days in slavery. According to “Latin American dance” in <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>:</p>

				<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After slavery ended in 1888, sugarcane workers migrated to the cities; many of them settled on the hills surrounding <a href="http://academic.eb.com.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/EBchecked/topic/504192/Rio-de-Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. These <a href="http://academic.eb.com.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/EBchecked/topic/202893/favela"><i>favelas</i></a> (shantytowns) became the incubators for Rio <a href="http://academic.eb.com.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/EBchecked/topic/96363/Carnival">Carnival</a> <a href="http://academic.eb.com.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/EBchecked/topic/520397/samba">samba</a>, as its inhabitants organized themselves into <a href="http://academic.eb.com.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/EBchecked/topic/520400/samba-school"><i>escolas de samba</i></a> (“samba schools,” which functioned as community-based clubs). (2015)</p>

			<p>Today, the culture only shared between slaves became national music. The cultural diaspora through slavery and mix of European culture had significant influence in their media. The history of slavery and the ancestors of Afro-Brazilian people become a root of samba music, customs, and dances.</p>

			<p>Expanding on the architecture study earlier, the thought of environment where character grew up can be important factor in defining the goal in life and the motivation for him or her in life. Also, looking at music and architecture helps build a world where the character evolves. What became of him or her? How did one’s environment affect him or her? How will Captain feel about the condition of slums? If he is from one, what would motivate him to achieve in life?  Compare and contrast of existing Brazilian comic is needed in order to create distinct character.</p>

			<h4>Comic </h4><br>

			<p>Another popular culture in the country is comic industry. There are talented Brazilian artists, who work at well-known comic companies in United States such as DC comics.  Lisa Shaw and Stephanie Dennison (2005) states that “[along] with the United States and Japan, Brazil is one of the world’s three largest market for comics, known in Brazil as <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hist%C3%B3ria_em_quadrinhos_no_Brasil"><i>história em quadrinhos or gibis </i></a>” (p.170).  Start of comic in Brazil began with newspapers containing illustrations and caricatures in eighteenth century. These illustrations and caricatures often contained criticism about society and political rule. Such influence in comic is due to censorship and limited freedom of expression starting with coup d'état of 1964 and emerge of military dictatorship around 1970s. Many cartoons criticizing politics or social fad were published in magazines from publishing companies such as Ciro Editorial. Roberto Elísio do Santos (2007) tells that artists at Circo often focused on ‘urban middle class‘ as they attempted to portray of foolishness of ‘society dominating classes‘ using ‘comic humor’ (p. 112). The cartoons from the time after dictatorship still continued to contain ‘comical humor’ and focused on topics immediately relating to the reality of culture. Similar phenomenon occurs in the television in Brazil. The ‘narrative mode’ of telenovela — type of serialized drama—   after 1980s “emphasized immediacy and actuality rather than fantasy and remoteness.” (Hamburger, 2003, p. 107). Similar to comic by Circo Editorials, the telenovela focuses on reality and reflects upon the current issues. Esther hamburger (2003) explains:</p>

				<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Staged in contemporary times, shot in the studios, but including external sequences shot on location, incorporating contemporary slang and fashion, making references to social and political events and to real places, <i>novelas</i> retained the original melodramatic narrative structure, but situated the stories in contemporary times and in well defined spaces. (p. 107)

			<p>With cartoon style comics, Brazilian artists and illustrator contributed in making of original comic or illustrations for big companies such as DC comics. Many artist worked on well-known American comics such as <i>Green Lantern</i>, <i>Teen Titans</i>, <i>Batman</i>, <i>The Shield </i>and many more.

			 This patterns shows that Brazilian artists are notable workforce in comic industry. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vss3eegtgXw&amp;list=PLeTl-bg7SFfpy1MbE9-Dq63ZEIekncqz_&amp;index=3">Eduardo Pansica, a Brazilian DC Comics illustrator</a> tells that, “when [he] started working in 2009, there were already number of Brazilian illustrators that come before. So, the industry already trusted [their] work” (CCTV America, 2014). How about iThe influence of American comic also evident in political cartoons. The scale of enthusiasm for comic industry in Brazil can be seen at a pop culture conventions such as Comic Con Experience. <p>

			<h4>Brazilian Comics Examples </h4><br>

			<p>Most known piece of comic strip is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6Fs1m857bM">Monica’s Gang</a> by Mauricio de Sousa who had a huge success with the comic and ended up franchising the story of a girl named Monica and her friends. It has been remediated into various video games and films. “Mauricio de Sousa's beloved comic books are a staple of many Brazilian childhoods” (Manthei, 2011, p. 142). He has many other comic characters loved by many Brazilian children.</p>

			<p>Another interesting comic is <i>Capitão Brasil</i> by <a href="https://pt.gravatar.com/universox1">Julian Rock</a>. It is a short comic strip about adventure of character who portrays characteristic of <i>malandro </i>through his nonsensical behaviour. In daily life, he seems to be a generic office worker. Even when he is in super hero attire, Captain Brazil does not display characteristic of heroic figure.

			He is mainly portrayed as a sloth (homem-preguiça) who wears a suit designed in  colors of yellow and green, which immediately recalls Brazil’s national flag. With blue sphere symbol from the flag, a letter B is embedded to represent Brazil. This part is similar to Captain America’s suit design following colors of American flag. Although he has superhero like appearance, his deeds seem to appear comical and troublesome than reliable or helpful.</p>

			<p>Only time when heroic characteristic seems to be embodied by this character is when  he displays super power such as deflection of bullets with his body, flying and few other abilities. He attempts to help out people with their ordeal, however it often results to a further complication of the event or a comical result. As for other characters in the comic, there are mainly people in need of assistance and an antagonist figure, a pizza man. Often, the comic strip includes hero and heroine from another comic such as Spider man.</p>

			<p>Besides <i>Capitão Brasil </i>with style similar to American comic, there are comics with styles incorporating Japanese art style.<i> </i>Although Japanese are small portion of the whole population, the aesthetic of Japanese comic style are replicated in comics by Brazilian artists. Web comics such as <a href="http://comborangers.com.br">Combo Rangers</a> (1998) by Fábio Yabu and <a href="http://www.xdragoon.com">XDragoon</a> (2008) by Felipe Marcantonio contains aesthetic following Japanese art style often used in Japanese comic known as manga. Similar to Japanese Super Sentai series - meant to be designed for long-run - such as Power Rangers, Combo Rangers have distinctive colors representing each protagonists.</p>

			<p>XDragoon, a story about an adventures and battles of two humanoid dragons, Alfred and Rocky including human women, Renata.The series has been remediated into short animated videos, a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXLGUaoYjgo">pilot episodes</a> and clips. Also, there is a spin-off of the series called <a href="http://www.xdragoon.com/destaque/xdragoon-rockstar-1-2-na-anime-dreams/?lang=en">XDragoon Rockstar</a>.</p>

			<p>Brazilian comic includes dynamic styles since it integrates many different art styles and cultural elements. One example is when Japanese culture is presented using Japanese names for characters in Brazilian comics. In Mauricio de Sousa's <i>Chico Bento,  </i>Japanese-Brazilian boy appears. <i>“</i>Hiro, a Japanese Brazilian boy, wears shoes and a cap (a marker of urbanity); he has more material goods and urban savvy than Chico, and is described as preserving Japanese cultural elements (MSP, "Hiro")” (Manthei, 2011, p. 146). Here, the part of minority culture has been included in comic of well-known Brazilian comic artist. This further shows the importance of minority culture in the popular culture of Brazil.</p>

			<p>Based on this knowledge, it brings up consideration for side kick character development in Brazil’s version of Captain America. In the second movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/">Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)</a>, Captain America has a sidekick named Falcon.  It would be an interesting notion to add a sidekick character similar to Falcon but to make it cultural appropriate, I would look at minor population and culture in Brazil. Besides the national identity represented and embodied by the captain, the sidekick can be Japanese-Brazilian with to represent the dynamic multicultural society of the country. Or the side kick can be the Afro-Brazilian side kick to explore the social aspects revealed in the Brazilian media, which can be studied for fundamental understanding of the Brazilian culture.</p>

			<h4>Conclusion</h4><br>

			From European colonist to World Cup, the modern Brazil has rich and complex community born from cultural phenomena associating issues of globalization, social inequalities and popular sports. These popular culture contains ideas, which are closely associated with the national identity. The complexity born from the multi-cultural society brings a lot of tension in the society. Brazil shows strong contrast between the poor and rich landscapes. Brazilian national identity has many layers. It more than just elite white culture. There are Afro-Brazilian, Asian and Indigenous communities. Indeed, Brazil is an country with unique concepts in each media.
