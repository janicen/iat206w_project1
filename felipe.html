			<h2>Russia</h2>

			<p>Russia is the largest country in the world, taking over about 1/8 of the world inhabited land area. There are many different ethnicities and cultures in this vast area. Although in this paper, I will be talking about Russia as a whole. Hired by the famous comic book company Marvel, it is my assignment to research this vast culture and adapt, the very popular, Captain America to the Russian scene. I have decided to research Russia through ten different concepts. Chosen, not only to provide a basis for my arguments in a structured way, but also to help alleviate the work of whoever choses, or has to, read this, by not subjecting them to an overly difficult paper to skim through. These ten concepts are based around the idea of symbolism and what that represents for people.</p>

			<p>Captain America is the super hero based in the time of WWII. He helped the United States and its allies defeat Nazi Germany. He was and still is a signal of hope and encouragement. Being a fictitious character early on, those who loved him only saw him as an icon; a superhero from comic books. Later, actor Chris Evans was cast to play Cpt. America. Having a representation of this super hero as a person, a real person, gave us an iconic face to put to the masked character. Although Captain America has an alias, known as Steve Rogers, we can all agree it’s nice to have an actual face to add to this hero. In this paper I will talk about which is the best way of representing Captain America in the Russian scene. Whether it will be as a masked hero, or an iconic actor that people can look up to. Both have their fortes, having Cpt. America represented by a popular Russian actor, gives the Russian people the equivalent feel that Americans have when seeing actor Chris Evans. Although, representing him as a masked hero with no famous background will give people the gratification that it could be anyone. Someone to look up to, but also with a feeling of “I could be him”.</p>
