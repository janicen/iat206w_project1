			<h2>Russia</h2>

			<p>Russia is the largest country in the world, taking over about 1/8 of the world inhabited land area. There are many different ethnicities and cultures in this vast area. Although in this paper, I will be talking about Russia as a whole. Hired by the famous comic book company Marvel, it is my assignment to research this vast culture and adapt, the very popular, Captain America to the Russian scene. I have decided to research Russia through ten different concepts. Chosen, not only to provide a basis for my arguments in a structured way, but also to help alleviate the work of whoever choses, or has to, read this, by not subjecting them to an overly difficult paper to skim through. These ten concepts are based around the idea of symbolism and what that represents for people.</p>

			<p>Captain America is the super hero based in the time of WWII. He helped the United States and its allies defeat Nazi Germany. He was and still is a signal of hope and encouragement. Being a fictitious character early on, those who loved him only saw him as an icon; a superhero from comic books. Later, actor Chris Evans was cast to play Cpt. America. Having a representation of this super hero as a person, a real person, gave us an iconic face to put to the masked character. Although Captain America has an alias, known as Steve Rogers, we can all agree it’s nice to have an actual face to add to this hero. In this paper I will talk about which is the best way of representing Captain America in the Russian scene. Whether it will be as a masked hero, or an iconic actor that people can look up to. Both have their fortes, having Cpt. America represented by a popular Russian actor, gives the Russian people the equivalent feel that Americans have when seeing actor Chris Evans. Although, representing him as a masked hero with no famous background will give people the gratification that it could be anyone. Someone to look up to, but also with a feeling of “I could be him”.</p>

			<p>Russia is composed of a vast and extensive culture. With over 140 million people living in the country today (Country Economy, 2013), some of the world’s most impressive notable past achievements came from the Russians. They created the AK-47 and the PK-gun which are very popular weaponry, on top of being the leading experts back in the day for space travel, with a founding father of rocketry and aeronautics, and being the first to have an artificial satellite in space, with Sputnik 1.</p>

			<p>The Russians played a huge and crucial role in the defeat over Nazi Germany in WWII. With over 20 million dead, Russian casualties were the highest of all nations in the war (History, 2000). Considering this, I believe that creating a super hero based off Cpt. America in conjunction with their culture, would not only be entertaining, but also very appealing, considering all they had to go through in their contributions and immense casualties in WWII.</p>

			<p>The fictional character Steve Rogers was a scrawny kid growing up during the Great Depression. In 1940, disgusted at Nazi Germany’s horrific atrocities, he tried enlisting in the army. He failed to pass the physical requirements because he had too many medical conditions. Failing to do so, he was asked to participate in Operation: Rebirth, a project that was intended to enhance US soldiers to the height of physical perfection. After being injected with the “Super Soldier Serum”, Professor Erskine, the sole creator of the serum was assassinated by a Nazi operative; forever taking the secret of the serum with him to his death. Steve Rogers was the first and only test subject of the drug, and its effects allowed him to become the super soldier that the professor wished for.</p>

			<p>Steve Rogers, being the only receiver of the enhancement drug, he was assigned to serve as both a counter-intelligence agent and a symbolic US hero to counter Nazi Germany’s propaganda success. Propaganda in the Soviet Union was very powerful in influencing thoughts, beliefs, feelings, and actions. Known as communist propaganda, it was solely driven with the purpose of education, training, and most importantly the organizing of the masses (Connelly, 2000). It is still a very popular form of designing posters for different events. Mainly events having to do with organizing people and empowering those who view them. Back in WWII, the Russians used propaganda for many different purposes. For instance recruitment, this was an ongoing struggle to find people to sign up to the military to fight off the Nazi Germans who were knocking at their door. These types of propaganda for recruiting showed drawings of war and soldiers looking strong and committed, while others showed pictures of fathers embracing their soldier sons who were enlisted with the captions “proud of my son” (Knutas, 2002). Throughout the war, there were also a large amount of propaganda posters in Russia that were aimed to raise fighting spirit and morale. These were constantly shown around, letting people know that Russia was strong and unified in their fight with the Nazi. Captions like “our people and army are invincible” (Knutas, 2002) was just one of the many captions that raised hope, because it not only mentioned those who are in the front lines fighting the war, but also the working class, who help support the troops from back home. Other popular works, demonstrated the alliances of countries with Russia in the war. These showed pictures of Nazi’s being attacked from all fronts by the Red Army (the Russians) and their allies.</p>

			<p>Propaganda of the Russian Cpt. America would take many of the same design principles as Soviet Union propaganda. He would be shown in every poster for recruitment and raising morale. These propaganda posters started portraying the superhero as an icon in the war. Obviously this is all fictitious; none of these posters were actually used in real life. But showed themselves in the comics by Marvel. Marvel created Cpt. America to provide distraction of the events of the war. These comics showed this hero fighting alongside your brothers and sisters in the war against the Nazis. If Cpt. America was portrayed as a Russian superhero soldier it would look at lot like this picture.</p>
