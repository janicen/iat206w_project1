			<h2>Mexico</h2>

			<p>By using the primary culture found through Captain America, this section utilizes cultural and media concepts to approach a cultural study on the country of Mexico from understanding the behaviour and people of Mexico to its historical and modern events.  Throughout the essay, it begins by defining the concepts that makes up the country, followed by its technological advancements, then narrowing to the overarching principle of superheroes of Mexico.  Hence, this relates to how Captain America has been defined as an individual, the technologies used to create him as a superhuman, as well as the character in becoming a superhero.  As a result, within the cultural domain of  superheroes, the concepts of identity, nationalism, symbol, interface, network, graphic novel, television, film, translation, genre are used as a framework in exploring the Mexican country to derive a new superhero, such as a creation of Captain Mexico.</p>

			<p>Overall, Mexico is seen with either a Hispanic or Latino identity through its historical development, but most identifies themselves as Mexicans where identity “…is caused by a conflation of discrete phenomena.” through groups, cultural identities or ethnic categories that are always changing (p. 110, 2007, Eriksen).  As described by Schmal (2004), “[t]he Mexican Republic of the Twenty-First Century, boasting more than 100 million inhabitants, has evolved from many indigenous national five centuries ago into a single national entity, with Spanish as its primary language.” (para. 1, 2004, Schmal).  As a result, a 2011 survey was conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center and discovered that “…52% of U.S. Hispanics of Mexican origin usually described themselves as “Mexican” or “Mexico,” while 26% described themselves as Hispanic or Latino and 19% most often said they were American.” (para. 2, 2013, Desilver) as seen in the graph below.</p>

			<p>With the graph portrayed, this is a mean of social identification as Turner (1972) suggested that to define an individual, “…the individual’s knowledge that he belongs to certain social groups together with some emotional and value significance to him of the group membership…” (p. 18, 1982, Tajfel).  On a side note, an official adoption of the terms “Hispanic” and “Latino” occurred after numerous years of “…lobbying by Mexican-American and Hispanic organizations…” the law was passed in 1976 under the name of Joint resolution relating to the public of economic and social statistics for Americans of Spanish origin or descendent (para. 15, 2012, Lopez et al.).  However, when a Mexican describe their identity, most relate to “…their family’s country of origin over pan-ethnic terms.” where statistic shows that 51% of the population would use terms such as “Mexican” while 24% uses terms such as “Hispanic” or “Latino” and 21% would simply identify themselves as “American” (para. 7, 2012, Lopez et al.).  On the other hand, an example of the loyalty of one’s Mexican identity derives from the Cinco de Mayo (fifth of May) day which is “…widely celebrated in the United States, and not just among the 33.7 million U.S. residents of Mexican origin [but it is to] commemorates the 1862 victory of Mexican forces over an invading French army at the battle of Puebla.” (para. 1, 2013, Desilver).  Alternatively, even though the term Hispanic and Latino were established, Mexicans only identifies themselves as the following only if they self identifies themselves (para. 17, 2012, Lopez et al.) leading to a mix cultural identity to create nationalism.</p>

			<p>Nationalism in Mexico began upon “…a discourse of self-affirmation articulated by the criollo (Creole) elite in the late eighteenth century.” (p. 279, Peña), which elaborated itself after gaining “…independence from Spain and formed a Republic.” (para. 1, 2012, Phillpott) in order to strengthen its country.  However, the country has been trying to rebuild itself ever since the invasion using the methods of educational endeavors with missionaries teaching language and religion (para. 35, Petrovic).  Hence, the country requires a link to bring individuals together such that “[h]istorically, an important part played by nationalist ideologies in contemporary nation-states has been to integrate an ever larger number of people culturally, politically and economically.” (p. 25, 2007, Eriksen) through education.  Next, during the colonial period, the aim of the Spanish Crown was to create a civilization of the indigenous population such that Heath noted in 1972, “[c]omplete linguistic and cultural assimilation was essential to the Crown’s goal of one culture, one language, and one religion.” (para. 38, Petrovic).  During the nineteenth century, while Mexico is starting to develop its nationalism, the creation of “…the new national unity stirred debate…liberals and conservatives struggled against each other for influence.” where each group had their own beliefs in driving a nation-state and means of promoting it (para. 42, Petrovic).  Eventually, for Mexico to transform itself, the country began to focus on various types of nation-state, as described by Diaz-Couder in 1997, this includes “…an open economy, integration into the international market place, stability to attract foreign investment, and increased democracy.” (para. 1, Petrovic).  On the other hand, the most successful method was to promote nationalism through education where Mexicans embrace multiculturalism, especially in assigning Spanish as a required language to preserve its cultural roots in the country (para. 2, Petrovic).  Also, by doing so, it “…provides evidence of the importance of respecting [every person’s] backgrounds…” especially their linguistic backgrounds (para. 32, Petrovic).  In order to obtain this state, Solana explained in 1981 that the country had to take control on education, as well as creating “…the Constitution of 1857…stating that education would be free and that the offices needed to implement it would be determined by law.” (para. 45, Petrovic).  By celebrating the individuals of mestizaje, meaning mix in Spanish, the country can be developed in a constitutional manner.  Furthermore, by integrating the society from a larger scale, it is achieved “…through the imposition of a uniform system of education, the introduction of universal contractual wagework, standardization of language and so forth…” which drives the goal of nationalism (p. 25, 2007, Eriksen).  This evokes how one is part of a nationalism where the social distinction is made by having “…insiders and outsiders; between citizens and non-citizens.” (p. 26, 2007, Eriksen).  As nationalism is not based on personal loyalty, it grows with its inhabitants, developing the country and the individual’s identities (p. 26, 2007, Eriksen) where Mexico has gone through this process to build its strength.</p>

			<p>Within the historic events in developing the nationality of Mexico, various symbolic items are used to represent Mexico which forms its “…most fundamental division of signs (para, 9, Heuning).  In terms of its name, it has been derived “…from the Aztecs, also known as Mexicas, who were warrior tribes that came from a place called Aztlán, thought to be in the northwestern region of Mexico.” (p. 1, SRE).  Furthermore, the meaning of its name came from the Aztec olden Nahuati spoken language, known as “Place in the center of the moon” which has now became the famous Mexico City (p. 1, SRE), acting as the heart of Mexico.  As for the flag, the design “…is taken from the French Tricolor flag.”, in addition, its colours indicate the national liberation army of Mexico (para. 1, World Atlas) upon the War of Independence with Spain during the years of 1810 to 1821 (p. 2, SRE).  In order to obtain its tricolour, it was also through the “…several different Mexican groups fighting for the creation of a new nation.” which formed the army of the Three Guarantees upon agreement to having “…an independent monarchy, one religion, and the union of all Mexican people.” (p. 2, SRE).  Hence, the symbolic colours of the flag reflect on the historic events such that green represents independence such as hope and prosperity, white represents the roman catholic religion, such as peace and harmony, while red represents the union of Spaniards and Mexicans, which is the blood of Mexican heroes (Mexico Flag) as the flag portrays below.</p>

			<p>Furthermore, the coat of arm features “...a Mexican Golden Eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus eating a snake.” which also has a powerful religious connotation to its people to demonstrate the goods (para. 2, World Atlas) as seen above, which is the same icon found at the center of the flag.  In terms of its historical story, a legend was told that the origin people of Aztecs wanted to leave home to start a new life where their God told them “…to find a lake where an eagle with a snake in its beak would stand on a nopal cactus growing from a rock.” to build their new city and that after much travelling, the arrival of the Valley of Mexico has now become Mexico City (p. 2, SRE) as sketched out in the historic times.</p>

			<p>Moving on, in the electronic industry of Mexico, it has been seen with a high focus in the creation of physical devices to run digital interfaces where this concept is “…to understand connections between the human and the machine…” by bringing the study of the virtual and physical space together (p. 53, 2008, Beer & Gane).  Ever since 1970, there were many Mexican companies that were producing “…computer and telephony equipment, processing units or laptop computers…” (para. 4, 2011, Pais).  However, the boom of technology caused a big gap between Latin American countries in comparison to first world countries, but with influences and a higher support in education, the technological growth has expanded once again which Latin America such as Mexico can soon catch up (para. 2, Heermann et al.) and become the leader in technological production within the Latin American countries in the Twentieth Century.  Also, Mexico has the responsibility in exporting at least $71.4 billion US dollars of consumer electronics and devices since 2010 (para. 2, 2011, Pais).  Then, this peak has transformed the electronic industry in Mexican companies to now produce a high demand in home appliances, cell phones, computers, flat screen television and video games (para. 4, 2011, Pais).  For instance, the company Meebox located in Mexico creates personal computers, tablets and mobile devices using the latest interfaces from Microsoft and Android.  Furthermore, as Mexico is a leading country in electronic production, Meebox is the first Mexican company to manufacture a completely functional tablet computer and Windows tablet (Rubio, 2011).  As demonstrated in the image below, they are a selection of the company’s products.</p>

			</div>

			<p>In terms of present day, as of 2011, “…the country is the second largest supplier of electronic products to the U.S. Market.” which can potentially become a world leader in consumer electronics industry (para. 1, 2011, Pais).  In short, along with the transformation of hardware, soon Mexico will be making new interactive user experience interfaces that can shape the way we interact with our world.  </p>	
			
			<p>By revisiting Captain America and its successful movies as a premise, it has been seen that the recent movie demonstrated a high box office rate which was potentially caused by its awareness spread through social network, such as watching and sharing the trailer, teaser videos and leaked clips.  Hence, the use of network in connecting the links and nodes of the mesh within a sociological system helps explain that Mexico is currently “…the fourth-fastest-growing country in the world for social network.” (para. 4, 2013, Shosky).  Also, it “…is the second leading country in Latin America in terms of unique visitors to social networking sites.” (para. 4, 2014, Marchant).  Furthermore, with a comparison to UK, “Mexico is the fifth most active country on Twitter with over 12 million active users, doubled the number of active Twitter users in the UK.  As for Facebook, Mexico and the UK are about even with an estimated 38 million active users in Mexico and 33 million active users in the UK.” (para. 2, 2013, Shosky).  Additionally, this has been affected by the growing middle class which is 39% of the population (para. 3, 2013, Shosky) all having access to the Internet, especially that 65% of the social media visitors are within the age of less than 35 years old (para. 8, 2014, Marchant).  As for activities, “[s]ocial media sites have become a way for people in Mexico to connect with family, friends, merchants and other people in an informal way…” similarly to accidentally sparking a conversation in a park or market and that Facebook pages are highly used in almost every city or region in Mexico to buy, sell or trade goods (para. 2013, Shosky).  In terms of data traffic, the main categories used on Facebook in Mexico are news, entertainment and media (para. 12, 2014, Marchant), such that the “…movie theatre chain Cinemax has more than 1.4 million fans.” (para. 9, 2015, Mexico Social Media).  Therefore, this leads to how “[v]ideo is one aspect that is driving internet usage.  Mexico ranks fifth in the world with 81% of all internet users viewing online videos and music videos being watched by 44%.” (para. 5, 2013, Shosky).  Hence, the statistics discussed are shown in the images below as a mean of visualization in comparison to other countries.</p>

			<p>In the case of the popularity growth of Captain America, on the forums of IGN and Mameworld, they are examples of how word of mouth can spread interesting information to promote Captain America and potentially a Captain Mexico as seen in the links below.</p>

			<p>As a result, the connection amongst people can arise “[w]hether wide or local, a network is distinguished by an underlying architecture or topology.” (p. 16, 2008, Beer & Gane) which the large population of Mexico has become connected through social media.</p>

			<p>In the ancient times of Mexico, illustrations and comic strips were already present under “…a long tradition of pictorial storytelling in Mexico that dates back to pre-Hispanic times.” (para. 1, 2013, Critchley).  Despite the popularity of comic books in Mexico, cartoonists believed that it is considered as low class work (para. 13, 2013, Critchley) where there were originally no intension to improve the basic storytelling method of a comic to a graphic novel.  However, one day, “…Josefina Larragoiti’s publishing firm Editorial Resistencia has become a pioneer of publishing graphic novels, a genre previously ignored by the mainstream…” (para. 1, 2013, Critchley) where their mission is “…to open a niche for young, unknown writers…” (para. 3, 2013, Critchley).  Here, it is seen that the powerful medium of “[g]raphic novels combines text and pictures equally in order to convey a narrative.” can portray meaningful stories where the visual representation of a story are introduced by sequential placement of words from dialogue or descriptive writing, as well as images of the art and design (para. 15, Thompson).  Surprisingly, their company received a bombardment of manuscripts of essays, children’s stories and graphic novels (para. 3, 2013, Critchley).  After the accomplishment revealed from the graphic novel Monorama, it’s first incursion, the firm’s catalog of graphic novels has increased, meaning that it is a popular market (para. 4-5, 2013, Critchley).  As a result, Larragoiti explains that “Resistencia opened the way for the graphic novel in Mexico…it has been a success and it has given Resistencia a push and a window into the market…” (para. 16, 2013, Critchley) where the image below is an example of their work.</p>

			</div>

			<p>Furthermore, the company took the risk in promoting this domain where “[s]ix years ago [from 2013] nobody published them, and there was no shelf space in bookstores, where the genre wasn’t considered ‘literature’, but now there are graphic novels on sale in all bookstores [in Mexico]…” (para. 17, 2013).  Alternatively, Mexico has always had a historic tradition in publishing historietas which are small formats of adult comics (para. 12, 2013, Critchley) that have a similar style and target audience as graphic novels, but they were not label as graphic novels due to its content, as seen below.</p>

			</div>

			<p>Hence, by extending graphic novels from comics, originated from codices, the history of graphic novels offers a foundation in portraying the storytelling mediums of Mexico (para. 8, 2013, Critchley) prior to technological mediums.</p>		
			
			<p>Then, the creation of television has offered many individuals, such as Mexicans to become informed with information through this media which is “…a system for reproducing an actual or recorded scene at a distance on a screen by radio transmission, usually with appropriate sounds; the vision of distant objects obtained thus.” (para. 2, Ensign).  Prior to its existence in Mexico, it began with an experimental television transmission conducted by Francisco Javier Stavoli in 1931 from Cuemavaca to Mexico City (para. 1, Barrera).  Afterwards, Guillermo Gonzalez Camarena also experimented within this domain by first building his own monochromatic camera and that this study has lead him to develop a Trichromatic system which evoked the creation of colour television and that his achievement was confirmed in 1940 with the first patent in this domain (para. 1, Barrera).  Next, Camarena created XE1GGC-Channel 5 in 1946 which was the first Mexican experimental television station to begin with weekly transmissions (para. 1, Barrera).  As a result, with the breakthrough of television and its regulations applied, “…television in Mexico has been dominated by a handful of powerful individuals and family groups.” (para. 5, Barrera) which gradually made its way available to the general public.  Eventually, after many conflicts between privately own sectors, the media company Televisa became a “…dominance in Mexican television…[and] provides over 12,000 hours of television programming each year…” (para. 14, Barrera).  For instance, television plays a major role in influencing one’s lifestyle in Mexico such that it is a cause for obesity where “Mexico is restricting television advertising for high-calories food and soft drinks, as part of its campaign against obesity, the government says.” (para. 1, 2014, BBC) and the main television programming of soap operas (para. 14, Barrera).  Through the observation of causality in television, it has been noted that it offers great strength in broadcasting information.  An example would be that even a live TV show promotes a parody of Captain America to Captain Mexico as seen below.</p>

			<p>Hence, with the development of television, it “…is a dominant cultural force that has aided in generating the term “media” as a somewhat unavoidable household presence in the life of a modern human…” (para. 1, Ensign), that has influenced the lifestyle of Mexicans.</p>

			<p>In terms of the film industry in Mexico, its growth has gone through a great journey to become its success in the modern day.  Prior to diving into the culture of Mexican film, the creation of a film comprises various elements from its predecessors which include books that are similar to a screenplay, music which are the original soundtrack scores found in movies and photography such that a film is composed of moving images (Media Theory, January 14, 2015).  First, during the United States invasion in 1847 to 1848, Mexico and United States developed a not amiable companionship after Mexico lost half of its territory by the end of the war (p. 3, 2014, Serna).  However, the turn around was that there were many American films welcomed and started to screen in Mexico, which brought a shift in the Mexican culture known and the Yanqui invasion (p. 3, 2014, Serna).  Noted by Kristin Thompson, this metaphor “…would become almost universal in discussions of expanding the American film trade abroad.” (p. 3, 2014, Serna).  While the films were brought from American corporations, they were injected with high level fidelity in technological advancements which has impressed Mexicans when they watched the films in movie theatres, schools and other venues (p. 1, 2014, Serna) and lead Mexico in learning the techniques to grow in the film industry.  For instance, Latin American films dominated prior to the Golden Age where the production rate in 1940 and 1955 releases 100 features a year which brought its recognition to the sixth largest industry in film, while Hollywood in United States could not make its comeback until after World War Two (para. 2, The Americas: !Accion!; Mexico's film industry).  As a result, with the growing population in film, the Mexican Institution of Cinematography even brings “…portable screens to neighbourhoods that lack cinemas, holding free screenings for Mexican flicks.” to bring awareness of films and encourage people to see more at theatres rather than pirating them online (para. 7, The Americas: !Accion!; Mexico's film industry).  Thus, as seen in the poster and promotion video below, the Mexico International Film Festival and Awards has been created to celebrate the importance of the film industry in Mexico and to show the innovation of arts and cultural community of Mexico (para. 2, Mexico Film Festival).</p>

			<p>As a result, with the absence and presence idea in film indicated by Hayward (2006), the imaginary setup serves the purpose of bringing the absent spectators into the immersed environment of the film as a mean of presence upon watching the film in terms of absorbing the surrounding sound and visuals (p. 4) which Mexicans has been awed by this fascination.</p>

			<p>In order to provide similar meaningful experiences, translation is often required to enhance culture, such as in the film industry that gets exported to various countries.  Here, translation will be used as first “…the process of turning one language into another”, the second being “…the expression or rendering of something in another medium or form…” while the third is the “…transformation, alteration, change; changing or adapting to another use; renovation.” (para. 1, 2007, Lund).  For instance, the Latin American movie titles of Knight of the Night, Super Agent 86 and The End of Time, “…are the literal translations of the Spanish titles given to The Dark Knight, Get Smart and The Happening…” where the creative translations used by Hollywood are to lure the large number of important foreign audiences (para. 2, 2008, Hawley).  Furthermore, with the cultural differences and language barriers, there are times that are necessary to alter the titles in order to not offend or scare the audience (para. 7, 2008, Hawley).  For instance, a moviegoer indicated that the title The Dark Knight, known as Caballero Oscuro in Spanish is considered too scary which might confuse the movie watchers in seeing a horror movie (para. 10, 2008, Hawley).  Alternatively, even though there is the aspect of titles getting lost in translation, it is necessary to have meaning in another language otherwise there is no interest to the movie and that the plot cannot be given away within the title (para. 20-21, 2008, Hawley).  An example can be seen in “Theima & Louise, a buddy film that shocked moviegoers with its suicide ending, was named  An Unexpected End in Mexico.” (para. 22, 2008, Hawley).  In terms of revisiting the project premise of Captain America, this movie also has content translated to suite the culture of the country, such as first translating its language as seen in the trailer below.</p>

			<p>Also, in Captain America: The Winters Soldier, the protagonist carries a to-do list notebook with him for him to catch up on the pop culture after being frozen in the war.  While the American version alludes to characteristics of Americans, the Latin American version had a list of learnings about the Chilean Miner’s Rescues which was an important event of 33 miners being trapped for more than two months (para. 11, 2014, Hallowell), followed by Shakira who’s a Colombian singer and Octavio Paz who’s a Mexican poet-diplomat and writer which results in resonating movies to the targeted countries (para. 5, 2014, Tower).  Hence a comparison image can be seen below.</p>

			<p>In the genre of superheroes, they have become an iconic language to Mexicans, where this concept consists of a broad meaning of kind, sort and style for a particular domain (para. 1, 2003, Clinton).  The main spark began in the 1990s upon an explosion of companies that began to create native Mexican superhero characters (para. 1, 2002, Mexican Superheroes and Villains).  In terms of design, in the genre of superheroes, they are often seen with masks, known as masked wrestler characters, which is their equivalent of the WWF wrestlers (para. 4, 2002, Mexican Superheroes and Villains) in alluding to one of Mexican’s famous sport in pro wrestling.  As for the characters’ personalities, they would fight monsters and criminals instead of with wrestlers in a ring where examples composed of the Blue Demon, Tinieblas and Mil Mascars to name a few (para. 4, 2002, Mexican Superheroes and Villains) as portrayed below.</p>

			<p>With the influence of fictionist superheroes, there is also now the existence of “…real life superheroes of Mexico [which are] being compared as the Mexican “Power Rangers” but they wear Lucha Libre masks and capes.” (para. 2, 2014, Lastra).  The rise of the characters Peatonito (Super Pedestrian). Ciudadina (Super Citizen) and Ecologista Universal (The Universal Ecologist) was due to an unorderly country which “…continues to deal with the growing pains of their own industrial revolution – overcrowded cities and crime…” (para. 4, 2014, Lastra).  Here, because one would not expect to see street cops to handle the situations of terrible traffic control (para, 1, 2013, Case), the superheroes would appear to warn for instance cars to stop behind the pedestrian lanes, teaching others to throw away their garbage or informing them not to be rude on the streets in a crowded space, as well as providing delight to the country (para. 4, 2014, Lastra).  With the presence of real life superheroes, they are actually “…wrestling for their rights…” (para. 4, 2013, Casey), especially in bringing awareness to pedestrians.  For instance, there is a promotional commercial created by the team as seen below, along with images to their contribution to the community.</p>

			<p>However, prior to Peatonito, there was also Superbarrio Gomez, who dressed up in a red outfit and “…helped displaced Mexico City dwellers find housing after the 1985 earthquare.” (para. 8, 2013, Casey).  Thus, Mexicans uses the genre of superheroes to become an iconic image and do a good deed to the community.</p>

			<p>In summary, the discussion of various conceptual aspect of the country Mexico offers insights in creating a new Captain America particularly for Mexico.  In terms of portraying the identity, nationalism and symbolism of the country, the superhero will need to encompass the interchangeable identity of Hispanic and Latino individuals, in addition to its iconic image of a Mexican and American, known as mestizaje, followed by the visual iconic symbols of a Golden Mexican Eagle to symbolize its strength while bearing the Mexican colours of red, white and green.  Next, his skills as a highly educated individual consists of being tech-savvy and very social, as seen that Mexico is becoming one of the largest countries to produce consumer electronics, a huge breakthrough in the film industry and television industry, as well as its people have a high traffic rate on Facebook and Twitter.  Lastly, within the genre of superheroes, his physical outfit appearance also consists of a mask to allude to the masked wrestlers seen in Mexican pro wrestling.  Hence, this big superhero on the outside, but kind hearted on the inside can provide delight to its people and potentially spread universally across the globe.  As a result, some examples and comparisons of Captain Mexico design found on the web can be seen below.</p>
