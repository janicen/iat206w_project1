			<h2>United Kingdom</h2>

			<p>Superman, Batman and Spiderman, these characters are known all over the world. Initially introduced in comic books by Marvel Comics, their popularity have let to multiple Hollywood productions. Although superheroes are fictional characters with supernatural powers, they often have aspects that make them relevant, that people can relate to. A superhero often has a touching background story and encounter conflicts in the fictional world that is taken from the real world. Nationalistic superhero takes that concept further and embodies an entire national identity of a culture. The famous Captain America, a nationalistic hero representing the United States of America is a great example of that. However, has being designed specifically for a culture made it alienating to other cultures? 
Captain America was introduced during the Second World War as a Hitler Punching super soldier [image 1]. This essay was initially sparked by the curiosity towards Captain America’s international popularity. According to the foreign revenue of the Captain America film “Captain America: the winter soldier” published by boxofficemojo.com, the answer to the question is yes, Captain America is popular worldwide.

			<p>According to boxofficemojo.com United Kingdom was one of the countries that generated high revenue, making it a key market for Captain America. Due to the existence of Captain Britain, instead of remodeling Captain America to fit the British culture, this essay leverages the popularity of Captain America in UK and explores the concept of pop cosmopolitanism and localization. The essay proposes a cultural bridge between Captain America and Britain in a form of a British partner who fights next to Captain America. The interaction between the crime fighting duos would resemble the real world Anglo-American relationship. </p>
			
			<p>Pop cosmopolitanism is a concept that will be reference throughout the essay. The essay will begin with examining the concept of pop cosmopolitanism and the internationalization of American comics and more specifically how the British culture has adapted them as a case study. Next, I will examine types of relationship that exists amongst the crime fighting duo, and determines what kind of relationship is best suitable for Captain America and his British partner to reflect the relationship between UK and America. The last section of the paper digs into the specific character design and dynamics of the British partner. </p>
			
			<p>The term “pop cosmopolitanism” first appeared in “Globalization: Culture and Education in the New Millennium” (2004) by Marcelo M. Suarez-Orozco and Desiree Qin-Hilliard as a way of describing cultural materials escaping it’s local context and grows into a global environment.  Suarez-Orozco and Qin-Hilliard referred to it as “the ways that the transcultural flows of popular culture inspire new forms of global consciousness and cultural competency.” (Suarez-Orozco and Qin-Hilliard, 2004, p. 117). The authors explore the idea in detail through the study of influences that eastern cultures have towards the American culture. The American Micky Mouse is an example of this. Once the cultural goods reach a new environment it undergoes transformation as two distinct cultures interact. One of the example was the American adaptation of the Japanese children TV series Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger [Video 1], known as the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers [video 2]. The show went under extensive change to be localized for the American market, from the obvious dialogue dubbing to, recasting American actors and reshooting footages in Southern California (Suarez-Orozco and Qin-Hilliard, 2004). Although Suarez-Orozco and Qin-Hilliard’s essay focuses on the cultural exchange between the American and eastern culture, the same kind of transnationalism can be applies towards the American and British culture, and it wouldn’t be a hard task given their long standing relationship. This would be explored further later in the paper. </p>

			<p>The Marvel characters may not have the same sturdy stance as Micky Mouse in the global market, but the company has made its name in the global market, especially with the acquisition by Disney  in 2009 (The Guardian). For the British culture, Marvel was a familiar name long before that. Marvel UK was formed in 1972 as imprint of Marvel comics, and distributed reprints of the comic book series. (Stevens, 2011) Localization is a concept that stem from pop cosmopolitanism, where cultural differences undergoes a translation process. Marvel and Disney realize that the Captain America as a symbol that represents United States of America may make it hard to accept for foreign culture have developed strategies for localization and cultural relevancy. Recent localization strategy of Captain America is shown through the two block busters, “Captain America: The First Avenger” (2011) and “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” (2014). Localization of film productions is common for large Hollywood productions. The obvious translations include language and censorship accommodations. In the case of Captain America, extra caution was taken into account for the title of the first tile “Captain America: The First Avenger”.  Marvel and Disney are aware of the controversy surrounding a film about an American super-soldier, therefore offered alternative movie titles to foreign countries. Most of the country kept the original name “Captain America: The First Avenger” while Russia, Ukraine and South Korea opted for “The First Avenger” dropping the first part of the title (Shoard, 2011). While some form of localization is done as cautionary acts, there are also alterations made for comic effect. In the second Captain American film “Captain America: The Winter Soldier”(2014), a brief scene has been customized for different cultures. The specific scene shows a close up of Captain America’s list of important events that he missed for the last 60 years while he was frozen in the Arctic ice. This specific list has different international versions, which showcases moments that are significant for a specific region [image 2-10]. For UK the list is shown as the following:</P>
			
			<p>
			<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
			  <li>TV Show – Sherlock</li>

			<p>Movie screen shots posted by Lucia Westwick, a movie enthusiast, on his tumbler page shows 7 additional versions of the list scene customized for South Korea, Mexico, Italy, France, Spain, Australia and Brazil [image 2]. These variations show Marvel/Disney’s ongoing effort to increase the acceptance of Captain America as well as to draw the audience closer to the character. This essay leverages this kind of cultural translation and proposes a cultural crutch for Captain America to be more relevant to the British culture in a form of a British crime fighting partner. Before going into cultural translation strategies for Captain America in UK, we need to examine the British attitude towards foreign influences and more specifically American influences. Understanding reception, response or any sensitivity towards cultural influences can provide insight towards the design of the British partner and his relationship with Captain America. </P>

			<p>UK has never been perceived as a closed nation. Like most country in Europe, given the density and close proximity of European nations, cultural influences are inevitable. A cultural article on the website of the popular newspaper publisher The Telegraph titled “Foreign crazes adopted by British kids” exemplified the wide acceptance of foreign cultural products by British Culture. The list includes “One Thousand and One Nights” the Middle Eastern folk tale, “Tintin” the Belgian comic series, “Histoire de Babar” the French children’s book and “Pokemon” the Japanese anime. Many of the adoptions are known worldwide by the British Empire and have been translated into many languages. Cultural influences in Britain cannot be talked about without touching on multiculturalism. The statistics of ethnic group in UK between 2002 and 2009 released by Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that there is an average of 4.1% annual growth of non-“White British” from 2002 to 2009. Among the ethnic groups, the Chinese population shows the highest growth rate of 8.6% annually. By 2011, according to the ONS census, non-“white British” makes up 19.3% of the total population. In response to the increase of ethnic groups, UK has grown to be concerned of its national identity. In “British National Identity and The Dilemmas of Multiculturalism”(2008), an essay by Eva-Maria Asari, Daphne Halikiopolou and Steven Mock states that there is a lack of overarching British identity that draws on its empirical past. The authors highlight the issue through an announcement made by the British Minister of Education in 2006 suggesting compulsory education of “core British values” for the ages of 11 an 16 (Asari, Halikiopolou and Mock, 2008). The seriousness of the issue is emphasised thought the linkage to the July 7th London bombing, where the bombers where British Citizens. Asari, Halikiopolou and Mock claims that the bombers have placed their own religious identities prior to the British state when they are in conflict, therefore, “ the lack of a successfully mobilizing, inclusive civic British identity came to be seen as the cause of large-scale divisions within the United Kingdom that could increasingly serve as a source of friction and conflict.” (Asari, Halikiopolou and Mock, 2008). Leveraging the nation’s concern of a unified identity, a hero character that embodies the British Identity could be welcomed. Similar to Captain Britain, who was first original character introduced in 1976 by Marvel UK, an imprint of Marvel Comics. Captain Britain’s success amongst the nation came from he’s embodiment of the British Identity. </p>
			
			<p>In addition to multiculturalism, the British Culture has also considered United States to be a long term threat towards British Identity. In the essay “Wrestling with America: Media, National Images, and Global Village” (1996), Alasdair Spark points out that the long standing relationship and lack of language barrier between British and American allows for unenviable cultural exchange that have led Britain to become “victims to Americanization” (Spark, 1996, p.91). Looking back at the concept of pop cosmopolitanism, the steps to localize a foreign cultural product usually involve translation of language, either through subtitle or voice dubbing. Some appeal of the product may get lost when it’s not viewed as it was intended. For example, a joke might lose its effect in translation or a song may not be relatable because the lyric is in a different language. This kind of language barrier does not exist between United States and United Kingdom. Spark summaries the relationship by quoting Winston Churchill’s satirical remark that “Britain and America are two cultures divided by a common language”( Spark, 1996, p. 83) , which isn’t much of a division.  This concern may be an overreaction or outdated, given that the influence of British Culture on America have always been present and seems to be growing rapidly, and exemplified by the influences of British TV shows such as Pop idol, which America have adopted, produced and broadcasted an American version called America Idol that became widely popular even outside of America. In the recent years, the adoption became even more fluid, with shows like Sherlock Holms and Downton Abbey, British TV shows are broadcasted as it is instead of reproducing American versions. According to PBS American broadcast television program, their viewing figures showed that there was 8.5 million viewers who tuned in to watch the season finale of Downton Abbey Season 4 (PBS, 2014). Hollywood entertainment site Deadline.com reinforced British entertainment industry’s footprint in American in an article after the Emmy award which made the statement “the British aren’t coming — they’re here to stay” (Tartaglione, 2014).  Nevertheless, the sensitivity towards Americanization should be considered when designing the British allies for Captain America. While both Captain America and his British allies should reflect the ideological views of their own nation, they must also have an understanding of each other’s culture in order to fight alongside each other.  The relationship between Captain America and his British allies should be established in a way that reflect the relationship between United States and United Kingdom we need to study the Anglo-American relations. </p>
			
			<p>An Anglo-American relation is most referred as the “special relationship”. H. C. Allen’s “Great Britain and the United States: a history of Anglo-American relations” (1954) provides an in-depth analysis of the policy from 1783 to 1952. Development of friendship between United Kingdom and United States began after a peaceful settlement of a dispute in 1814, and that led to alliance and ongoing collaborations between the two nations. However, the rapid growth of the United States and the decline of Britain, the relationship shifted,  resulted in Britain’s rising concern as a junior partner who is dependent economically (Allen, 1952, p.11). The phrase “special relationship” originated during the Second World War, coined and popularized by Winston Churchill (Reynolds, 1988). For Britain, the “special relationship” was a “national approach to the Europe-wide problem of dealing with American power” (Reynolds, 1988, p.98). Although, Britain and America hopped between rivalry and partnership back and forth, viewed co-operations as serious as competition, many still believe that the relationship is “special”. A. Dobson and S. Marsh conducted case studies in their article “Anglo-American Relations: End of a Special Relationship?” (2014) and identified historical lessons where two nations were on the opposing side, but they’ve managed to re-establish their relationship. For example, at the end of the cold war saw the weathering of the Anglo-American relationship because there wasn’t any more common enemy that gave them excuse to stand on the same front line. However, the relationship flourished as a new driver, the ban on nuclear testing, brought the two nations together once again. Similarly, when 9/11 happened, two nations directed their focus toward the War of Terror (Dobson and Marsh, 2014). Historical evidence has shown that the shared value and view on the world have allowed both United Kingdom and America to provide support for each other. Britain may be a junior partner to United States, but it’s their most needed partner. Dobson and Marsh further explains the importance of Britain to America in the following quote:</p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 80px; margin-right:50px;">This need is not military, albeit niche contributions are welcome. Rather, it is for reliable allies that can and will offer political, security, economic, moral, and value support as the United States seeks to protect an international system that reflects and supports its hegemony. There are still none better, more consistent, or more capable than Britain in doing this. (Dobson and Marsh, 2014, p.26)</p>
			
			<p>Translating this complex relationship into fictional duos will be difficult, therefore this essay have adopted a case study strategy sought out fictional British duos that can be used as a reference. First, we will look at the famous detective duo, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Specifically in the TV show Sherlock. In the show they were referred to as Sherlock and John, where Sherlock is the lead detective and John supports him in his investigation. Given Sherlock’s self-centred personality he believes that John needs him. It is true, as a veteran, John needs Sherlock to have a sense of purpose and to avoid social degeneracy. However, this relationship is mutual; Sherlock also needs John’s humanizing traits to keep Sherlock, a sociopath, from turning into a criminal. Although there are similarity between Sherlock-John relationship and the Anglo-American relationship such as professional support and mutual dependency, John’s support towards Sherlock seems less tangible, and more on the emotional level. The significance of his contribution professionally cannot represent the degree of support and contribution that British have demonstrated historically for United States. Furthermore, Sherlock and John live under the same roof, so their dependency for each other is much too intimate in comparison to the Anglo-American relationship, which seems to exist only on a co-operative level. Another professional duo that could be considered is James Bond and the Quartermaster in Skyfall, the 2012 film. The Quartermaster, referred to as Q in the movie. Historically Q is the technical officer who supplies James Bond with high tech gadgets that can aid him in his mission. In Skyfall, in addition to supporting James Bond in the back end, Q also step into the front line and takes on a hacker role of hunting terrorist threats. Although he does not fight side to side with James Bond physically, he’s providing well timed support that ensures the mission goes smoothly.  The relationship between the two is mostly professional. James Bond would contact Q when in need, and Q provides him exactly that. There is also a sense of independence between the duos. Q has his own line of work, he’s life does not evolve around James Bond, and James Bond is the one man army that occasionally seeks help. When Q and James Bond first met James Bond questioned Q’s ability because of his young age [video 3]. Q then rebuts by suggesting that James Bond’s method of in field fighting is outdated and inefficient versus using modern technology. There is a hint of friction between the two characters’ interactions that is comedic to watch. This could be adapted for Captain America and the British partner to establish a relationship that is close but conflicting at the same time without stirring controversy. There isn’t going to be a perfect duo that Captain America and the British partner can adapt, but a simple framework can be established to shape the interaction between them. 1. it’s not friendship, but mutual respect. 2. British ally’s role will be supportive but not subordinate. 3. The occasional tension between Captain America and the British partner can be used for comic relief.</P>

			<p>We will now move on to the character design of the British ally. Super heroes are often presented with physical appearances that can be identifies as handsome with male physiques that embodies masculinity. A quick look at British’s history on male aesthetics, Paul R. Deslandes, the author of “The Male Body, Beauty and Aesthetics in Modern British Culture” examines the beauty of male body in the twentieth century of Britain. According to Deslandes, the focus on male body was mainly driven by the development of sports and Masculinity is often described in words such as “self-sacrificing and team-oriented” (Deslandes, 2010, p.8). By the late nineteenth-century, Britain went thought a brief bread trend that lasted through out 1880s and died down in the 1890s (Deslandes, 2010). The modern beauty standard can be examined through the popular British celebrities who are known for their “looks”. In an article published by glamourmagazine.co.uk, a popular tabloid new site in UK, and written by Hannah Lyons Powell, identified and ranked a list of male actors based on physical appearances. The article provides a sense of British beauty standard of men. The following actors ranked top five on the list (Lyons Powell, 2014):</p>
			
			<p>
			<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
			  <li>1. Robert Pattinson</li>
			  <li>2. Max Irons</li>
			  <li>3. Tom Hiddleston</li>
			  <li>4. Tom Sturridge</li>
			  <li>5. Jamie Campbell Bower</li>
			</ul> 
			</P>
			
			<p>Four out of five of the top five actors have blue eyes and are blonde. The blonde hair blue eyes traits are common for the other 30 actors on the list. These traits should be considered when designing the comic character. Whether the traits are perceived as beautiful or they are simply common in the British culture should be further examined. The comic character should meet the beauty standards of British culture, but also embody “Bitishness” in his physical appearance. </p>
			
			<p>A comic character cannot grab the audience’s attention if it’s just an empty shell, no matter how beautifully he is drawn. The character dynamic establishes the background, personality and believes of the character are important as well. The character dynamics of British Superheroes will be examined to identify patterns that can be developed as a framework for Captain America’s British ally. All character information is gathered from comicvine.com a well-known comic online database that also hosts forum discussions for the comic enthusiasts. </p>
			
			<p>The origin of the superhero’s supernatural powers is a large part of what defines the superhero. The theme of magic is repeated in the story of British Super heroes. The elements of magic can be seen from the very first British superhero, Captain Britain. Although Captain Britain was modeled after Captain America an importance difference comes from the origin of their super powers. While Captain America took the science rout and became the super-soldier after the injection of super-serum, Captain Britain’s powers were much more magical. </p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 80px; margin-right:50px;">As the Reaver and his men closed in to finish Brian off, the two mages gave Brian a choice between the ' Amulet of Right' and the ' Sword of Might'. Deciding he wasn't much of a fighter, he selected the amulet and was transformed into Captain Britain, easily defeating the Reaver's men. (Fesak, 2015)</p>
			
			<p>Knight, another popular British Hero known as the Batman of Britain also received help from magic. The source of his power came from the magic armor that his father made and wore. Aside from British comic characters modeled after American characters, culturally exclusive characters have also adopted this magic element. Shamrock, an Irish superhero that possesses superpower of luck received her power through super natural means. </p>
			
			<p style="margin-left: 80px; margin-right:50px;">Shamrock (also known as Molly Fitzgerald) is an Irish superhero born in Dunshaughlin, Ireland. When Molly was 3 years old, she obtained her powers inadvertently. Her father took her and her brother to the North Mountains in Ireland where their father prayed to the Gods to give his son, not Molly, great powers to strike down his father's enemies. (KillerZ, 2013)</p>
			
			<p>When designing the British ally character the magic element should be considered. Although it is important to include magic into his narrative, it is also crucial for him to have humanistic traits that the audience can relate to. </p>
